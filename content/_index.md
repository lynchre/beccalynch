## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a data scientist at [Duo Security](https://www.duo.com). My current work involves detection of fraudulent authentications, and improving the robustness of our ML pipeline.  


I attended the University of Michigan, where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science. While there, I also studied physics and music, developed and installed a [radiological measurement system](https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2018/11000/A_Radiation_Weather_Station__Development_of_a.6.aspx), and served as a teaching assistant for [Computer Security](https://eecs388.org/).

Currently, I am completing a Master's in [Computer Science and Data Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs/online-master-computer-science-data-science) at the University of Illinois in my free time.

I also enjoy [playing music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwhAvFy_hMjUUNhxsuxgilg) with friends, and am the co-host of a [silly podcast](https://twitter.com/theunholypod).

## Research Interests

I am primarily interested in the intersection of data science and public policy, with an emphasis on public health and climate change. I've done some projects involving Google searches and what they can tell us, including using [symptom searches](https://lynchre.github.io/covid_trends/) to understand the spread of a pandemic, and an exploration of Google searches for candidates as it relates to the results of the [2020 Iowa Caucus](https://public.tableau.com/profile/becca.lynch#!/vizhome/IowaCaucus_15926860334120/Dashboard1).

Additionally, I'm incredibly passionate about improving computer science education. I am currently working on an interactive blog as an exploration into improving the way we teach core machine learning concepts.

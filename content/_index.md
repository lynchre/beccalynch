## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a data scientist at [Duo Security](https://www.duo.com). My current work involves detection of fraudulent authentications, and improving the robustness of our ML pipeline. 

I attended the University of Michigan, where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science. While there, I also studied physics and music, developed and installed a [radiological measurement system](https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2018/11000/A_Radiation_Weather_Station__Development_of_a.6.aspx), and served as a teaching assistant for [Computer Security](https://eecs388.org/).

Currently, I am completing a Master's in [Computer Science and Data Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs/online-master-computer-science-data-science) at the University of Illinois in my free time.
